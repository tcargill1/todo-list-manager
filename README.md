# To-Do List Manager

A C++ application to manage tasks with features for adding, viewing, and removing tasks, as well as saving and loading tasks from a file. This application also allows multiple people to manage a shared todo list. This project demonstrates key C++ concepts like the STL, smart pointers, file I/O operations, inheritance, and polymorphism that I wanted to work on as I haven't tackled C++ in a while.
